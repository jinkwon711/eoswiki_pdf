https://github.com/yakivmospan/github-wikito-converter suitable wiki code


thanks to yakivmospan , we can easily create pdf with github wiki

but some TOC file should meet standard, and also should contain appropriate file.

in EOS wiki, SIDEBAR(TOC) does not contain wiki information, so I moved TOC from _Home.md to _Sidebar.md

and removed some yaml and base code that github-wikito-converter does not interpret.


if you want to make pdf from eos wiki

just clone this repo and clone github-wikito-converter and follow yakivmospan's guide.
