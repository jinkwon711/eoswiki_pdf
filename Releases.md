[1] This release is not self-identifying

NOTES: 
* Software releases can be found [here](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/releases "EOS.IO Releases").
* Tags (bundles of code that go together for deployment, mostly between releases) can be found [here](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/tags "EOS.IO Software Tags").
* Tags can never provide a document that includes themselves. Therefore the above list, when located in Readme.md, cannot include the latest tag. This same list when found in a wiki can include the latest tag.

[a] #hotfix Beginning in 2018, Hotfixes are tagged as "DAWN" and the year, month, and day of their release, formatted as DAWN-yyyy-mm-dd. If two hotfixes are on one day, the second has a lowercase 'a' appended, the third has a lowercase 'b' appended, etc., as in "DAWN-2018-03-03b". The Hotfix tags can be used by sophisticated developers to download the latest code to come out of each weekly sprint, and to access hotfixes that may be released mid-sprint. There may not be any Release Notes explaining a particular Hotfix release, or such notes may be terse. Documentation is not released on a Hotfix schedule; the public should not expect to find up-to-date documentation connected to any Hotfix tag. (Exception: Doxygen automated documentation will still be up to date with each tag.) . Any tag that is not an official release will also include the suffix "APLHA" to denote that this release may have unresolved bugs.

[b] #release Beginning in 2018, Releases are tagged as "DAWN" and "-R" for Release, then the Major Release number and the Feature Release number, formatted as DAWN-Rmaj.fea. For example, "DAWN-R3.1" â€“ this is Major Release 3, Feature Release 1 within that major release. The Release tags should be used by average developers to download stable releases that have up to date documentation and Release Notes.
