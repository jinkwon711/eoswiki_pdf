## Hello World Contract
**This tutorial assumes that you have completed tutorials [Getting Started With Contracts](Tutorial-Getting-Started-With-Contracts) and [Eosio.token, Exchange, and Eosio.msig Contracts](Tutorial-eosio-token-Contract).**

We will now create our first "hello world" contract.  Create a new folder called "hello", cd into the folder, then create a file "hello.cpp" with the following contents:

### hello/hello.cpp
```
#include <eosiolib/eosio.hpp>
#include <eosiolib/print.hpp>
using namespace eosio;

class hello : public eosio::contract {
  public:
      using contract::contract;

      /// @abi action 
      void hi( account_name user ) {
         print( "Hello, ", name{user} );
      }
};

EOSIO_ABI( hello, (hi) )
```

You can compile your code to web assembly (.wast) as follows:
```
$ eosiocpp -o hello.wast hello.cpp
```
**NOTE:**  The compiler might generate warnings.  These can be safely ignored.

Now generate the abi:

```
$ eosiocpp -g hello.abi hello.cpp
Generated hello.abi
```

Create an account and upload the contract:

```
$ cleos create account eosio hello.code EOS7ijWCBmoXBi3CgtK7DJxentZZeTkeUnaSDvyro9dq7Sd1C3dC4 EOS7ijWCBmoXBi3CgtK7DJxentZZeTkeUnaSDvyro9dq7Sd1C3dC4
...
$ cleos set contract hello.code ../hello -p hello.code
...
```

Now we can run the contract:

```
$ cleos push action hello.code hi '["user"]' -p user
executed transaction: 4c10c1426c16b1656e802f3302677594731b380b18a44851d38e8b5275072857  244 bytes  1000 cycles
#    hello.code <= hello.code::hi               {"user":"user"}
>> Hello, user
```

At this time the contract allows anyone to authorize it, we could also say:

```
$ cleos push action hello.code hi '["user"]' -p tester
executed transaction: 28d92256c8ffd8b0255be324e4596b7c745f50f85722d0c4400471bc184b9a16  244 bytes  1000 cycles
#    hello.code <= hello.code::hi               {"user":"user"}
>> Hello, user
```

In this case tester is the one who authorized it and user is just an argument.  If we want our contact to authenticate the user we are saying "hi" to, then we need to modify the contract to require authentication.

Modify the hi() function in hello.cpp as follows:
```
void hi( account_name user ) {
   require_auth( user );
   print( "Hello, ", name{user} );
}
```
Repeat the steps to compile the wast file and generate the abi, then set the contract again to deploy the update.

Now if we attempt to mismatch the user and the authority, the contract will throw an error:
```
$ cleos push action hello.code hi '["tester"]' -p user
Error 3030001: missing required authority
Ensure that you have the related authority inside your transaction!;
If you are currently using 'cleos push action' command, try to add the relevant authority using -p option.
Error Details:
missing authority of tester
```

We can fix this by giving the permission of tester:

```
$ cleos push action hello.code hi '["tester"]' -p tester
executed transaction: 235bd766c2097f4a698cfb948eb2e709532df8d18458b92c9c6aae74ed8e4518  244 bytes  1000 cycles
#    hello.code <= hello.code::hi               {"user":"tester"}
>> Hello, tester
```

## Hello World Ricardian Contract
Every smart contract must have a matching Ricardian contract.  The Ricardian Contract specifies the legally binding behavior associated with each action of the smart contract.  The Ricardian Contract for the Hello World Contract is listed here.
