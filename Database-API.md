## **1. Overview**
The data are organized according to the following broad structure:

 - Scope - an account where the data is stored
 - Code - the account name which has write permission
 - Table - a name for the table that is being stored
 - Record - a row in the table

Every transaction specifies the set of valid scopes that may be read and/or written to. The code that is running determines what can be written to; therefore, write operations do not allow you to specify/configure the code.

> **Note:**
Attempts to read and/or write outside the valid scope and/or code sections will cause your transaction to fail.

The data APIs assume that the first bytes of each record represent the primary and/or secondary keys followed by an arbitrary amount of data.

## **2. Modules**

### **2.1 Data C API**

#### **2.1.3 Dual 128 bit Index Table**
Interface to a data table with 128 bit primary and secondary keys and arbitary binary data value. 

![enter image description here](https://eosio.github.io/eos/group__dbi128i128.png)

##### **2.1.3.1 Description**

*Parameters*

- scope	- the account where table data will be found
- code	- the code which owns the table
- table	- the name of the table where record is stored
- data	- a pointer to memory that is at least 32 bytes long
- len	- the length of data, must be greater than or equal to 32 bytes

*Returns*

the total number of bytes read or -1 for "not found" or "end" where bytes read includes 32 bytes of the key
These methods assume a data table with records of the form:

> struct record {
   uint128  primary;
   uint128  secondary;
   ... arbitrary data ...
};

You can iterate over these indicies with primary index sorting records by { primary, secondary } and the secondary index sorting records by { secondary, primary }. This means that duplicates of the primary or secondary values are allowed so long as there are no duplicates of the combination {primary, secondary}.

#### **2.1.4 Triple 64 bit Index Table**
Interface to a data table with 64 bit primary, secondary and tertiary keys and arbitrary binary data value. 

![enter image description here](https://eosio.github.io/eos/group__dbi64i64i64.png)

##### **2.1.4.1 Description**

*Parameters*

- scope	- the account where table data will be found
- code	- the code which owns the table
- table	- the name of the table where record is stored
- data	- a pointer to memory that is at least 32 bytes long
- len	- the length of data, must be greater than or equal to 32 bytes

*Returns*

the total number of bytes read or -1 for "not found" or "end" where bytes read includes 24 bytes of the key
These methods assume a data table with records of the form:

> struct record {
   uint64  primary;
   uint64  secondary;
   uint64  tertiary;
   ... arbitrary data ...
};

You can iterate over these indices with primary index sorting records by { primary, secondary, tertiary }, the secondary index sorting records by { secondary, tertiary } and the tertiary index sorting records by { tertiary }.

##### **2.1.4.2 Example**

```
struct test_model3xi64 {
       uint64_t a;
